## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods

### Code Format

```javascript
/**
 * Description of the method
 * @param {string} param1 - Description
 * @param {Object} options - Options object
 * @returns {Promise<Object>}
 */
async methodName(param1, options = {}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### File Naming

- Use PascalCase for class files: `Player.js`, `Filters.js`
- Use camelCase for utility files: `helpers.js`
- Use kebab-case for config files: `eslint-config.js`

### Best Practices

- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately
- Avoid deeply nested code
- Use early returns when possible
- Add debug logging for important operations
